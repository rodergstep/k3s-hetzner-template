## Network Policy for External Services

The `django-network-policy.yaml` has been modified to allow egress traffic to all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0). This was done to accommodate the use of `ExternalName` services for Stripe, Brevo, and AWS S3, as `NetworkPolicy` resources do not directly support them. This is a temporary, less secure solution.

**Recommendation for a more secure setup:**

For a more secure solution, consider implementing a DNS-aware network policy controller like Cilium or Calico. These would allow you to create policies based on domain names, which is a more robust and secure way to manage access to external services.
